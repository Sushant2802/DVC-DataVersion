1. Create git repo and clone it in local.
2. Create mycode.py and add code to fit. (it will save a csv file to a new 'data' folder)
3. Do a git-commit-push before initializing dvc.

# pip install dvc 
4. Now we do "dvc init" (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
5. Now do "mkdir S3" (Create a new S3 directory")
6. Now we do "dvc remote -d myremote S3"
     ( # we crate S3 folder/bucket on PC/AWS , but we need to say the dvc where is the remote origin )

           ( # from now dvc is responsible for data versioning )
7. Next "dvc add data/"  
    Now it will ask to do : ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data")  
                ( # to stop tracking data by git)
    Because initially we were tracking data/folder from git so now we remover it for DVC to handle.
