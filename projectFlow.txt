1. Create git repo and clone it in local.
2. Create mycode.py and add code to fit. (it will save a csv file to a new 'data' folder)
3. Do a git-commit-push before initializing dvc.

# pip install dvc 
4. Now we do "dvc init" (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
5. Now do "mkdir S3" (Create a new S3 directory")
6. Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"
     ( # we crate S3 folder/bucket on PC/AWS , but we need to say the dvc where is the remote origin )

           
7. Next "dvc add data/"     
            ( # from now dvc is responsible for data versioning )
    Now it will ask to do : ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data")  
                ( # to stop tracking data by git)
    Because initially we were tracking data/folder from git so now we remover it for DVC to handle.

8. Again we do "dvc add data/" (crate data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"

9. Now "dvc commit" then "dvc push"

9. Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data.


10. Now make changes to mycode.py to append a new row in data, check changes via "dvc status"

11. Again - - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"

12. Then git add-commit-push (we're saving V2 of our data at this point)

13. Check dvc/git status, everything should be upto date.

14. Now repeat step 10-12 for v3 of data.
